Your Project's Name:
Don't Fall

Design Process
We made this website such that users of all ages are able to enjoy this game called Don't Fall. Don't Fall is a vertical platform game where the player controls a character and tries to climb as high as possible and try to reach the end.
If the player falls however, he would have to restart from where he fell off which can be frustrating. But this is also how we plan to hook our users.

There will also be an option button where user can choose which keyboard layout they would like to use such that it will fit them comfortably. For mobile players, they would be able to choose from 3 different joystick sizes to adjust to their liking.
