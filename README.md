Your Project's Name
Don't Fall

Design Process
We made this website such that users of all ages are able to enjoy this game called Don't Fall. Don't Fall is a vertical platform game where the user controls a character
and tries to climb as high as possible and try to reach the end.
If the player falls however, he would have to restart from where he fell off to which can be frustrating. But this is also how we plan to hook our users.

There will also be an option button where user can choose which keyboard layout they would like to use such that it will fit them comfortably.
